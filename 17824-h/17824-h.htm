<p>nce upon a time there was a little
black boy, and his name was Little
Black Sambo.</p>

<p>nd his father
was called
Black Jumbo.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_06b.jpg" alt="Black Jumbo" width="500" height="284" /></div>
<p>And Black Mumbo made him a beautiful little Red Coat, and a pair of
beautiful little Blue Trousers.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_07.jpg" alt="Black Mumbo made him a beautiful little Red Coat." width="500" height="668" /></div>

<p>And Black Jumbo went to the Bazaar and bought him a beautiful Green
Umbrella and a lovely little Pair of Purple Shoes with Crimson Soles
and Crimson Linings.</p>


<p>And then wasn't Little Black Sambo grand?</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_09.jpg" alt="And then wasn't Little Black Sambo grand?" width="400" height="520" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_10.jpg" alt="Dropcap" width="75" height="81" /></div>

<p>o he put on all his Fine Clothes and went out for a walk in the
Jungle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_10b.jpg" alt="o he put on all his Fine Clothes." width="500" height="373" /></div>
<p>And by and by he met a Tiger. And the Tiger said to him, "Little
Black Sambo, I'm going to eat you up!"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_11.jpg" alt="&quot;Little Black Sambo, I'm going to eat you up!&quot;" width="500" height="658" /></div>

<p>And Little Black Sambo said, "Oh! Please, Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up,
and I'll give you my beautiful little Red Coat."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_12.jpg" alt="Coat" width="300" height="398" /></div>

<p>So the Tiger said, "Very well, I won't eat you this time, but you must
give me your beautiful little Red Coat." So the Tiger got poor Little
Black Sambo's beautiful little Red Coat, and went away saying,</p>



<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_14.jpg" alt="Dropcap" width="75" height="97" /></div>
<p>
ow I'm the grandest Tiger in the Jungle."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_14b.jpg" alt="Tiger" width="400" height="272" /></div>

<p>And Little Black Sambo went on, and by and by he met another Tiger,

<p>o the Tiger said, "Very well, I won't eat you this time, but you must
give me your beautiful little Blue Trousers." So the Tiger got poor
Little Black Sambo's beautiful little Blue Trousers, and went away
saying, "Now I'm the grandest Tiger in the Jungle."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_18.jpg" alt="I'll give you my beautiful little Purple Shoes." width="500" height="665" /></div>

it said to him, "Little Black Sambo, I'm going to eat you up!" And
Little Black Sambo said, "Oh! Please, Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up, and
I'll give you my beautiful little Purple Shoes with Crimson Soles and
Crimson Linings."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_20.jpg" alt="Tiger" width="400" height="495" /></div>

<p>But the Tiger said, "What use would your shoes be to me? I've got four
feet and you've got only two."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_21.jpg" alt="&quot;You could wear them on your ears." width="400" height="414" /></div>

<p>"You haven't got enough shoes for me." But Little Black Sambo said,
"You could wear them on your ears."</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_10.jpg" alt="Dropcap" width="75" height="81" /></div>

<p>o I could," said the Tiger, "that's a very good idea. Give them to
me, and I won't eat you this time."</p>



<p>So the Tiger got poor Little Black Sambo's beautiful little Purple
Shoes with Crimson Soles and Crimson Linings, and went away saying,
"Now I'm the grandest Tiger in the Jungle."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_23.jpg" alt="Little Black Sambo met another Tiger." width="500" height="659" /></div>

<p>And Little Black Sambo said, "Oh! Please, Mr. Tiger, don't eat me up
and I'll give you my beautiful Green Umbrella." But the Tiger said,
"How can I carry an umbrella when I need all my paws for walking
with?"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image_25.jpg" alt="Umbrella" width="300" height="326" /></div>

  <div class="figright2"><img src="images/image_26.jpg" alt="&quot;You could tie a knot  on your tail" width="300" height="430" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"You could<br />
tie a knot<br />
on your<br />
tail,<br />
and carry<br />
it that way,"<br />
said<br />
Little<br />
Black<br />
Sambo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"So I could," said the Tiger. "Give it to me and I won't eat you this
time."</p>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_27.jpg" alt="So he got poor Little Black Sambo's beautiful Green Umbrella." width="500" height="650" /></div>

<p>So he got poor Little Black Sambo's beautiful Green Umbrella, and went
away saying, "Now <i>I</i>'m the grandest Tiger in the Jungle."</p>



<p>And poor Little Black Sambo went away crying, because the cruel Tigers
had taken all his fine clothes.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_29.jpg" alt="Black Sambo went away crying." width="500" height="505" /></div>

<p>Presently he heard a horrible noise that sounded like
"Gr-r-r-r-rrrrrrr," and it got louder and louder.</p>

<p>"Oh dear!" said Little Black Sambo, "There are all the Tigers coming
back to eat me up!</p>

<p>
What<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">shall</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">I</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">do?"</span><br />
</p>

<p>So he ran quickly to a palm-tree,</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_31.jpg" alt="So he ran quickly to a palm-tree." width="500" height="461" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_06.jpg" alt="Dropcap" width="75" height="93" /></div>



<p>nd peeped round it to see what the matter was.</p>

<p>And there he saw all the Tigers fighting and disputing which of them</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">was</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">the</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">grandest.</span><br />
</p>

<p>And at last they all got so angry that they jumped up and took off all
the fine clothes and began to tear each other with their claws and</p>

<p>
bite each other<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">with their</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">great big</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">white teeth.</span><br />
</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_03.jpg" alt="Tiger" width="600" height="230" /></div>



<p>And they came, rolling and tumbling, right to the foot of the very
tree where Little Black Sambo was hiding, but he jumped quickly in
behind the umbrella. And the Tigers all caught hold of each others'
tails.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_34.jpg" alt="right to the foot of the tree where Little Black Sambo was hiding" width="500" height="664" /></div>

<p>As they wrangled and scrambled, and so they found themselves in a ring
around the tree.</p>

<p>Then, when the Tigers were very wee and very far away, Little Black
Sambo jumped up and called out,</p>

<p>
"Oh! Tigers!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">why have</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">you taken</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">off all your</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">nice clothes?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Don't you</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">want them</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 14em;">any more?"</span><br />
</p>

<div class="figleft1"><img src="images/image_36.jpg" alt="Palm Tree" width="400" height="598" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
But</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="margin-left: 1em;">the</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Tigers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  <span style="margin-left: 3em;">only</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  <span style="margin-left: 4em;">answered</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  <span style="margin-left: 5em;">"Gr-r-r-rrrrr!"</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_37.jpg" alt="Little Black Sambo jumped up and called out." width="500" height="439" /></div>
<p>Then Little Black Sambo said, "If you want them, say so, or I'll take
them away." But the Tigers would not let go of each others' tails, and
so they could only say "Gr-r-r-rrrrrr!"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_38.jpg" alt="If you want them, say so." width="500" height="675" /></div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_06.jpg" alt="Dropcap" width="75" height="93" /></div>
<p>nd the Tigers were very, very angry, but still they would not let go
of each others' tails. And they were so angry that they ran round the
tree, trying to eat each other up, and they ran faster and faster till
they were whirling round so fast that you couldn't see their legs at
all.</p>

<div class="figright1"><img src="images/image_39.jpg" alt="Palm Tree" width="400" height="592" /></div>

<p>And they still ran faster and faster and faster, till they all just
melted away, and then there was nothing left but a great big pool of
melted butter (or "ghi" as it is called in India) round the foot of
the tree.</p>

<p>Now Black Jumbo was just coming home from his work, with a great big
brass pot in his arms, and when he saw what was left of all the
Tigers, he said,</p>



<p>"Oh! what lovely melted butter! I'll take that home to Black Mumbo for
her to cook with."</p>

<p>So he put it all into the great big brass pot, and took it home to
Black Mumbo to cook with.</p>

<p>When Black Mumbo saw the melted butter, wasn't she pleased!</p>



<p>"Now," said she, "we'll all have pancakes for supper!"</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image_42.jpg" alt="&quot;we'll all have pancakes for supper!" width="500" height="648" /></div>

<p>So she got flour and eggs and milk and sugar and butter, and she made
a huge big plate of most lovely pancakes. And she fried them in the
melted butter which the Tigers had made, and they were just as yellow
and brown as little Tigers.</p>

<p>And then they all sat down to supper. And Black Mumbo ate Twenty-seven
pancakes, and Black Jumbo ate Fifty-five, but Little Black Sambo ate a
Hundred and Sixty-nine, because he was so hungry.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
